Adaptive Route Evolution: Geospatial Algorithm for Logistics Optimization
This repository contains the source code and simulation framework for the research study titled "Optimizing Logistics Operations in Nigeria: 
Geospatial Algorithm with Adaptive Route Evolution." 
The project integrates A Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Reinforcement Learning (RL)* to enhance delivery route efficiency, reduce congestion delays, and
improve fleet management.
